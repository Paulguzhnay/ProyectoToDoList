   - Modify the `.env` file according to your environment configuration needs.

   Example command to create the `.env` file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```

   Make sure to adjust the values in the `.env` file to match your setup.

4. **Start the Application**:
   With everything set up, you can now start the application. If using Docker, ensure all containers are up and running. You can access the application through the provided local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
